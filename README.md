# technical_analysis
We are using technical_analysis_class.ipynb jupyter notebook to filter stocks on BIST based on given criteria. 
The strategy: first we are looking for RSI negative divergence, after that we are searching for RSI22-RSI66 break out and RSI22 downtrend break out.
After this process, we get around 5-10 stocks and by plotting the graph of this stocks, we are trying to choose the one for trade.
